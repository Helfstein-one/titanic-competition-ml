Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Everybody once heard something about the famous sank the Titanic ship. It was the worse disaster from that time 1910s.
The iconic tragedy was about a ship who was design to not sink. Ironic or not, we take the challange to predict 
who will survived from it. Next below we take step by step what happend in the tragedy. 

The Titanic sailed from Southampton, England, to New York, USA. On the night of April 14, 1912, at 11:40 pm, the ship hit an iceberg. The liner began to flood with thousands of tons of freezing water.

Thomas Andrews, who was on board, designed the ship. After inspecting the collision damage, he confirmed to the captain that they were going to sink.

At 00:15 on April 15, the Marconi system began emitting distress signals, wirelessly activating an entire network of frantically communicating ship operators and shore stations.

They used Morse code, a telegraphic communication system that forms words, numbers and other symbols using dots, lines and spaces.

"Come now. We hit an iceberg," warned Titanic's communications operator, Jack Phillips, to another ship, the Carpathia.

"We hit an iceberg and sank off the bow," the Titanic crew wrote to the Frankfurt, a German ship.

Jack Phillips relayed even more reports.

"We're sending passengers in small boats. Women and children in boats. They can't take much more. Losing power."

Another read: "This is the Titanic...engine room flooded."

The operators continued with the exchange of messages as the boats began to leave and the men said goodbye to their wives and children.

Jack Phillips did not survive the disaster. He remained at his post even after the captain released him from duty. Therefore, his heroism has been extolled several times in narrations about the tragedy.

Titanic's messages caused consternation and confusion on other ships.

At 2:10 am, the power went out and the communication system was shut down. The bow was completely submerged and the stern tilted.

Around 2:20 am, the ship split in two and the two halves began to descend to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

Less than two hours after the sinking, the Carpathia arrived in the area and rescued 700 survivors who managed to escape in lifeboats - which only had capacity for half of the people on board.

OK. So we understand some circutances happens in the time. When they decided who will get abord to the rescue boats - woman and children, right? That will be a criteria when testing our model, futhermore we must assuming another problems that will make this challange more fun.

So, let's understand more about the science about the tragedy.

The watertight compartments were useless to countering the damage done by the collision with the iceberg. Some of the scientists studying the disaster have even concluded that the watertight compartments contributed to the disaster by keeping the flood waters in the bow of the ship. If there had been no compartments at all, the incoming water would have spread out, and the Titanic would have remained horizontal. Eventually, the ship would have sunk, but she would have remained afloat for another six hours before foundering [Gannon, 1995]. This amount of time would have been sufficient for nearby ships to reach the Titanic's location so all of her passengers and crew could have been saved. http://writing.engr.psu.edu/uer/bassett.html

So why did the Titanic sunk? As shown in Figure 2, the ship is believed to have sunk due to multiple contributing factors.

Another concept we can investigade it will be the social criteria. If we manage to supose the ship was build to alocate the
rich in the highers levels and the poors in the lower levels, we can assume the rich got a advantage to get acess to
the small boats, but that is aproximation. Children and Woman continue to be first level of analysis, but we can invest more in this aproach.
